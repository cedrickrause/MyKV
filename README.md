# MyKV 

This is a very basic redis-like in memory database. It is roughly based on [this blog post](https://charlesleifer.com/blog/building-a-simple-redis-server-with-python/). 

It has a very minimal protocol implemented, just for the basic operations. My main goal here was to learn more about the lower level details working with TCP. I never quite came to finish up the last details.
